# Investment Philosophy Statement

## Purpose & Scope

Goal: this IPS documents long-term objectives, constraints and decision rules for Martynas Lozys investment portfolio and financial planning.

## Statement of Financial Purpose / Investment Objectives

Main goal: financial independence, defined as a large enough portfolio, which would enable me to maintain near current level of expenditure until death, given low enough withdrawal rate. Currently I'm 35, so hopefully later than sooner. Market returns are unpredictable, so TL;DR focus more on increasing income and keeping higher savings rate, instead of over-complicating asset allocation and portfolio construction. 

Assumptions:
- Equity real return 3-5% (base 4%)
- Bond real return 0-2% (base 1%)
- Inflation 2-4% (base 3%)
- Allocation 70/30%, currently closer to 80/20% but taking into account that will shift to bonds closer to retirement
- FI multiplier = 33 (based on 3% withdrawal rate)
- Saving rate 30 - 60% (base 50%)

Base scenario FI sum portfolio (current yearly expenses / withdrawal rate) will be reached in ~20 years, optimistic scenario in ~15, pessimistic in 30. If goal is reached sooner, it does not mean I will stop working or do something very differently, but it will give me more peace of mind and maybe I'll re-evaluate goal at the time. Overall, I tried to use quite conservative assumptions, such that even in pessimistic scenario expected portfolio value is realistic to reach.

Secondary goal: safety, defined as at least a year worth of expenses in liquid and stable assets, due to geopolitical situation, which might force me and family to flee country and/or incur unforeseen and uninsurable risks. This goal is in juxtaposition to the first one, so I need to balance safety against portfolio growth. I'm anxious about this and tempted to add more here, but decided to cap at 1 year of expenses for now to limit cash drag on returns.

Tertiary goal: child's fund / financial family safety. Expecting a child, so changed risk tolerance, as liquidity needs might arise, e.g. covering more expenses due to reduced wife's salary. Not explicitly planning for college, car or house deposit expenses, but keeping in mind that in 20 or so years I might need to withdraw a more considerable sum (say 10% of portfolio). I don't plan to open a separate investment account, but I do plan to help my child financially, based on situation at the time, taking into account other needs and portfolio value.   
This goal also competes with the main one of growing portfolio, because unexpected expenses might take away from contributions and knowing that time horizon of this goal is shorter, means more stable assets sooner, which slows growth.   
My parents seem to be in quite stable financial situation, but their wealth is highly concentrated in the company + apartment (so quite illiquid). I estimate risk of me needing to support them financially, especially in shorter term, to be very low.

## Current assets / liabilities

Human capital: currently I have a stable job allowing me to achieve ~50% savings rate (based of net income). Of which, employer + pre-tax contributions account to 10% of savings rate and II pillar pension fund contributions add another 5%. I perceive the job as secure, of course long term prospects remain uncertain as always (AI, wars, etc.).

Real estate: owning a home, with less than 10 year mortgage left, payments constitute less than 10% after tax income, so not a huge burden, especially sharing with wife. Loan to original value ratio is currently around 10%.

Life insurance: covering loan + ~15 years of current expenses + disability coverage to insure loss of labor capital.

Portfolio: currently around 15% of target FI portfolio worth, will be described later in the document.

Pension: another 5% of FI portfolio, accumulated in tax advantaged private fund (not counting state pension), early withdrawals are problematic, so realistically illiquid for another 30 years or so.

Private assets: own some stocks in parent's company, but I don't want to count these or project any dividend payments into the future, as I don't directly work at the company, so any potential proceeds should be treated as good fortune, but I don't expect anything.

## Risk Tolerance, Risk Capacity & Risk Constraints

Ability to take risk: honestly evaluating current assets/liabilities, ability to take risk is high, because overall financial situation is secure and there seems to be ample of buffers / few liabilities. I do however, recognize need of strong emergency fund, not to cushion stock volatility but for short term unexpected liquidity.

Willingness to take risk: I consider myself to be quite stoic, recent few years market movements haven't had effect on me, but also I have not lived through a true GFC style drawdown while owning a portfolio, so leaving some room for unknown unknowns, especially if crash coincides with personal life hardships - job loss, etc.

Need to take risk: my goal is on purpose quite low, such that there is no pressure to take extra risk unnecessarily (concentrated positions, leverage, speculative assets, complex instruments, etc.).

## Asset Allocation Policy & Ranges

### Assets classes

Given risk assessment, proceed with classic Pareto principle

80% stocks
20% diversifiers

### Stocks geography

Generally, follow market cap weights, currency unhedged. There could be argument made for more home country bias (EU) allocation, but decided against it because human capital, real estate and pension is already in EUR and EU already has quite substantial weight in global market cap.  
Current target allocations:
60% US,
30% ex-US,
10% Emerging.

### Factor tilts

I am quite convinced by Fama French 5 factor model, not that it is immutable law of finance, but I do believe that having significant exposure to other factors than market beta via low(ish) cost, long-only ETFs does provide additional diversification. Even if premiums decay over time or get arbitraged away and don't survive transaction costs, I still get exposure to market beta and expense ratio is not that much higher than global market cap weight ETFs.  

All academic papers, fancy statistics or risk vs behavior discussions aside, the plain statement that cheap companies (value), with good profitability metrics (quality), that aren't disliked by everyone (momentum) sounds like something that is generally true. 

From all the articles that I've read, seems like DFA/Avantis approach of systematic, integrated (multi-factor) and smartly traded is the way to go. I do understand that considerable tilts will result in tracking error compared to MCW, but I don't mind that, because I think factor tilts help me achieve my return target with higher certainty (more sources of not perfectly correlated returns). 

I don't think existence of factor premiums contradict the Efficient Market Hypothesis, because of ICAPM, investors have different risk profiles, time horizons, information, constraints, etc. and hence are optimizing for different objectives in their portfolios, so market anomalies occur. I do agree that definitions of factors (e.g. tangible vs intangible value) are evolving, so at the end of the day, it is a matter of belief not only in persistence of factors but also in quality of implementation.

### Equity target weights

- 30% Small cap value/profitability (AVWS) - these should be the riskiest stocks, because of higher embedded leverage, lower available information and liquidity, hence, expected premium likely to be highest. Contrarian bet, as they might underperform MCW for a long time (+10 years).
- 20% Momentum (XDEM) - there's quite considerable evidence that momentum and value diversify each other, as these momentum stocks are usually large cap growth, so companies beloved by everyone that tend to get too expensive sometimes. Because I don't intend to hold a MCW ETF separately, having considerable momentum allocation provides me exposure to FOMO companies (what if AI stocks go to the moon and I miss it?). It has less sound theoretical risk basis for premium, but very decent empirical record, hence, lower weight than SCV.
- 20% Large/mid value/profitability (JGPL)- SCV+MOM can be viewed as strong factor tilts satellite, whereas this part is more of a core/defensive, still considerable factor exposure but less volatile than other two and adds extra diversification, if e.g. small caps underperform. Additionally, it is reweighed by sectors so is more akin to equal weight fund, helps to diversify extreme tech concentration in MCW.
- 10% large/mid emerging market multi-factor (FLXE) - good evidence of diversification to developed markets, especially when USD weakens, but country specific risks is what keeps the premium alive.

### Bonds

5% German bunds (X03G) - all maturities, adding some duration, seems that for now German debt situation is best of worst options.

5% 0-5yr US TIPS hedged to EUR (CBUL) - wanted to add some inflation indexing at lower duration. Although not ideal, since its US, which has its own problems and CPI might not directly reflex EUR and there are hedging costs, but other options were also not that attractive (France, Spain, UK debt problems, longer duration, etc.).

I want to minimize currency risk, so bonds should be either EUR denominated or at least EUR hedged. Primary purpose is liquidity, so try to keep duration on the lower end, but might use non money market funds, as I don't know exactly when liquidity needs might arise. 

Equal split between inflation linked and nominal, as unexpected inflation is definitely a risk you want to avoid, if faced with sudden withdrawal need, similarly, nominals should perform better in case of deflationary crash. Using government bonds, need liquidity and safety, so credit risk is not something I seek here.

### Gold

5% Physical in USD (EGLN) - despite the fact its expected return is 0 and there are no cash flows, empirical evidence is pretty strong for decent diversification properties, especially in light of geopolitical risks and stagflationary pressures, so 5-10% allocation, seems prudent.

### Trend following

5% DBMFE - once again, very strong empirical evidence for diversification benefits and crisis alpha. However, differently from gold, there's considerable implementation and manager selection risk, high complexity, lower transparency and high costs. Besides, as of now there seems to be only single UCITS ETF (DBMF), which does not have super high expense ratio and minimum investment requirement. 

Because of manager risk, be careful to place more than 10% in one fund, even though this fund is replicator of CTAs and aims to capture asset class 'beta', so risk is somewhat mitigated. 

One could argue that the asset class itself warrants exposure as high or higher than bonds, especially now in increasing interest rate/higher inflation/stock-bond correlation environment.

### Leverage

Leverage along with derivatives and short-selling is one of the financial concepts I would prefer to avoid in my portfolio, if possible. It introduces complexity and additional risk (not only intended but also unintended risk of mismanagement) and is definitely not something I would try to implement myself. 

That being said though, I do acknowledge that there are some quite interesting products that use leverage to achieve better cash efficiency (return stacking). According to financial literature, the optimal portfolio construction approach is to find highest Sharpe ratio portfolio (so combining many independent sources of risk) and leveraging it to the desired level of risk. 

With leverage constraints investors are forced to keep very high allocations to equity (as is also the situation in my case), which concentrates risk in market beta. So unintuitively, moderate leverage (say 25-50%) might help to achieve better diversification with similar level of risk (although implementation risk is added). 

Again to my knowledge, right now there's limited number of UCITS funds (e.g. NTSG) that offer such products, but I would be open to consider them if they were available.

## Rebalancing & Drift Management

As a general rule of thumb I will use 5/20% (absolute/relative) rebalancing bands, so if asset's target weight is 20% and it grows to 24%, I will rebalance back to 20% (because of relative 20% deviation), similarly if asset's target weight is 50% and it moves to 45%, I will balance back to 50% (because of absolute 5% deviation).

For now in early accumulation phase, I will use monthly contributions to rebalance, because portfolio is small enough still to allow for it. Later, monthly contribution will become relatively smaller, so it will be harder to move weights, especially after larger market moves and when more assets classes are added (100% stock portfolio is highly correlated so weights don't change much, even if market moves a lot). At that point annual rebalancing should be performed along with IPS review.

Tilts/deviations should be documented in IPS, preferably as modifications to long term allocation/strategy, not as tactical shifts. General rule, try to avoid them, changes to IPS are ok and welcome, but should also be limited to once a year and should be gradual not radical (can't switch from 80/20 to 20/80 stocks/bonds in a year, but ok switch 75/25, if perceiving risk appetite as decreasing).

## Spending / Withdrawal Policy (if retired or drawing income)

For now I will not spend much time describing this as it is still quite far away, but general aim is for 3% withdrawal rate adjusted for inflation annually, which can be considered conservative, because 4% is the baseline used by many. I choose lower rate because it yields higher portfolio accumulation goal, so enforces higher savings rate, both of which allow more leeway if things don't turn out as expected. Realistically, if this plan does not go as expected, I think 4% withdrawal rate is sound, given that it can be flexible and vary e.g. 3-5% based on market returns that year.

## Liquidity & Emergency Fund

- Half month expenses in physical cash
- Current month expenses in bank account
- 6 month expenses in EUR money market (split across two independent providers)
- Credit card (10k limit)
- Main investment portfolio (last resort, in general should be avoided, unless explicitly withdrawing as e.g. planned child expenses)

## Tax Considerations

All capital gains are taxed at 15% in Lithuania, regardless if it is dividends, interest or any other source. 

Starting from 2025 tax year Lithuania established investing account for retail investors, meaning you can defer taxes on capital gains until funds are withdrawn, so need to mark this account for tax authorities when filling declaration.

Additionally, IBKR has an option of tax optimization when selling your positions (instead of default FIFO method), which prioritizes selling lots that currently have lowest profit, if bought at different points in time.

IIIrd pillar pension fund is tax advantaged, if used in retirement, so goal is not to touch this until the time.

IInd pillar pension is tax-free, but for now there aren't considerable funds here.

## Behavioral Guardrails

- Stock portion can fall up to -10% in a day and get cut in half over longer bear markets, which in real terms might take a decade or more to recover.
- A reasonable benchmark is 80% global stocks (e.g. SPYI) and global EUR hedged bonds (e.g. EUNA).
- I understand that because of deviations in factor tilts and alternatives in diversifiers my portfolio will have considerable tracking error compared to the benchmark, but expectation is similar return over long term with somewhat less volatility, because of better diversification.
- Based on these points, I should not sell long term assets during drawdowns and use liquidity/emergency fund for unforeseen circumstances. Underperformance of factors or diversifiers against benchmark may last a long time, sometimes more than a decade, so shouldn't be a cause to liquidate positions, unless IPS is fundamentally changed with regards to allocations, which as stated above is not to be done abruptly.

## Implementation, Allowed Instruments & Cost Guidelines

When selecting fund implementation, naturally prioritize ETFs with longer history, higher AUM, lower tracking error and lower expense ratios. However, recent research points out that blind index tracking at a low cost might actually lose more in performance than is saved by low TER, so systematic "active" management should not be ignored, even if it entails somewhat higher cost, but management needs to be trusted on implementation. So good track record on research, methodology and execution should be considered.

Typically global all cap + EM passive ETFs charge up to 0.2% TER in UCITS. For factor funds, especially if small cap multi-factor or EM, TER could be 0.3-0.4%. More exotic diversifiers, like trend following can be costly, but should not exceed 1.0%. 

Generally larger positions (>10%) should be in funds with at least $100M AUM, fund closure is not a taxable event, but it might take time to recover funds and there's reinvestment risk.

## Monitoring, Reporting & Review Schedule

Annual review of this document should be performed preferably after New Year to assess if goals, allocations and rules still apply or need modification. Use changelog to track what changes were made and rationale behind it.

## Changelog

### 2026-01-03
- Annual review. Tracking error ~2p.p. which is ok as stated. Main changes - added gold, DBMF, short term US TIPS. Sold short term German bunds (was 10%), reduced agg bunds from 10% to 5%. Rationale - already have EUR money market ETF in emergency fund, diversifying into alternatives more to guard against sovereign debt / stagflation / political instability more and reduce cash drag.
